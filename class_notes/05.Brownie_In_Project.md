# Introduction

## Installing Brownie

It's recommended to install brownie via pipx, because it'll install it into a virtual environment and makes it available directly throught the commandline. To install pipx, use:

* `python3 -m pip install --user pipx` (install pipx);
* `python3 -m pipx ensurepath` (Ensure directories necessary for pipx operation are in the PATH);

Close and reopen the terminal to update the Environment Variables. Then:

* `pipx install eth-brownie`;

... and close+reopen the commandline again.

## Errors

When I first tried to install brownie, it all went well until the `pipx install eth-brownie`. When I tried that command, athe pipx failed to build the packages, just like the error disclaimed [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69679343/pipx-failed-to-build-packages). 

I used one of the sugestions in this page and tried to install with `pip install eth-brownie`. That worked =D.

## Initialize a brownie project

Use `brownie init` to initialize a brownie project on the desired folder. It's going to create the following folders:

* **build:** tracks low-level information, like any interfaces, all our deployments (accross different chains), and store all the compiled code (contracts) for us;

* **contract:** this directory, outside the `build` folder, is where we'll put all our written contracts. Brownie will look inside of this folder for new contracts to compile;

* **interfaces:** save and store different interfaces;

* **reports:** we can save any report we want;

* **scripts:** we can automate tasks, like deploying, in any way we want;

* **tests:** 

We also get a .gitignore and .gitattributes files.
