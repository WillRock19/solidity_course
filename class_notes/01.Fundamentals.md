    // uint256  -> unsingned integer of 256 bits (not positive or negative)
    // int      -> integer
    // bool     -> boolean values
    // string   -> some type of string
    // int256   -> singned integer of 256 bits (can be positive or negative)
    // address  -> some ethereum address
    // bytes32  -> variable that shall store some 32 bytes value (like strings, number, etc. with 32 or less bytes)
    
    // EXAMPLES:
    
    // uint256 favoriteUnsignedNumber = 5;
    // bool    favoriteBool = false;
    // string  favoriteString = "The Phantom of the Sith is everywhere and nowhere";
    // int256  favoriteIntegerNumber = -5;
    // address favoriteAddress = 0x75773071458Df6F83cFb6E02586Ff992Cf736709;
    // bytes32 favoriteBytes = "cat";

    //ABOUT strings
    
        // In Solidity strings are not a value type, but an array of bytes. The variable of type string is a special type of array, where we can append text. Since 
        // it's a special case, when we pass it as parameter we must tell our program how it shall be stored (in 'memory' or 'storage') 
    
    
    // ============================================================================================================================================================

    // MAPPINGS
    
        // Are a dictionary-like data structure with 1 value per key;

    // You can add visibility modifiers to your functions or variables. They are:
    
        // external -> used for things that are part of the contract interface, which means it can be called from other contractsand via transactions. It cannot be
        //             called internally;
                   
        // public   -> part of the contract interface and can be called internally or via messages
    
        //internal  -> functions or state variables can only be accessed internally (from within the current contract or contracts deriving from it). It's the default
        //             visibility level for state variables
    
        //private   -> are only visible for the contract they are defined in and not in derived contracts

    // ============================================================================================================================================================
    
    // Different types of functions that does not use transaction fees:
    
        // View function -> it's the kind that read the state from a blockchain, so it doesn't use any fees to make a transaction

        // Pure function -> it's the kind that make math computations but doesn't change anything in the state (and, because of that, it does not use transaction 
        //                  fees either)

    // ============================================================================================================================================================


    // Memory x Storage keywords (when receiving parameters)
    
        // Memory  -> says the variable is going to be storage in memory only during the execution of the function call
    
        // Storage -> says the data will persist after the function be executed
