To create a fully usable Factory, it''s contract and the SimpleStorage factory must be in the same folder.

We can import codes in our file using *import* statement.

We can interact with contracts outside our contract, but for that we need two things:

        1. Contract address -> address where the contract was deployed in the network
        
        2. Contract ABI     -> is the Application Binary Interface. It tells solidity and other programming languages hot they can interact with another contract.
                               It's basically the result for which an interface is compiled to.
        
                               Anytime we want to interact with an already deployed smart contract, we gonna have to know the contract ABI.
                               
        
We can use hirehitance (heran√ßa) in our contracts. We just need to use the *is* keyword. Something like:

    import "./SimpleStorage.sol";

    contract StorageFactory is SimpleStorage
    {
        
    }
